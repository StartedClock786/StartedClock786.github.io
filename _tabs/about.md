Hey everyone, welcome to my blog!  
I work in software development and thought it’d be fun to start a place where I can share my thoughts and just write with a bit of style.  

What’s this blog about? Honestly, a mix of my life, random stuff I get into, and maybe some new hobbies along the way.  
It’s kind of like a journal for me, but I get to share it with you (and future me).
