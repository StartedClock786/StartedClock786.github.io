# iFixit Manta Driver Kit – My Honest Review  

*Quick note before I start: this isn’t a sponsored review, just my own experience and opinion.*  

[![iFixit Manta Driver Kit](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0045/4092/4007/files/CDEfZPcFPEOWRjBm.jpg?v=1728360904&width=800)](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0045/4092/4007/files/CDEfZPcFPEOWRjBm.jpg?v=1728360904&width=800)

I got the **iFixit Manta Driver Kit** as a birthday present back in May. The reason? I recently got pulled into the whole phone repair rabbit hole (but that’s a story for another post). Since then, I’ve been using this kit pretty regularly, and I thought it was about time to share how I feel about it.  

## What I Like  

After a good few months of using it, I can honestly say I’m really impressed.  

I’ve been repairing phones, tablets, PCs, and other gadgets with it, and it’s been rock solid. The screwdrivers feel really good in the hand. The blue top spins separately from the black handle, which sounds like a small detail, but in practice it’s super handy when you’re dealing with lots of tiny screws.  

Another big plus is the **huge variety of bits**. So far, I haven’t come across a single screw I couldn’t handle with this kit. The bits feel sturdy and high quality. Honestly for me, it’s kind of satisfying knowing you’re covered no matter what device you’re opening up.  

## What I Don’t Like  

Now, the not-so-great part: the price. At around **€70** when I got it, it’s definitely on the expensive side. Don’t get me wrong—the quality is there, and you’re getting a lot of tools in one set—but for me, the price still feels a little steep. I know everything is more expensive these days, but if you’re only doing repairs once in a while, this might be a bit overkill for your budget. Nevertheless, I would never give it away.  

## Final Thoughts  

Overall, I’m really happy with the Manta Driver Kit. It feels great to use, it has every bit I’ve needed so far, and it makes the whole repair process a lot smoother. The only real downside is the price, but if you wait until it goes on sale, you can get a really good deal for the money.  


## Where to Buy It  

It wouldn’t make much sense for me to tell you how much I like this kit and then not share where you can actually buy it or find more information about it.
