In today's world the word software developer is thrown around quite a lot and almost nobody outside the field knows what it means, so I just want to try and explain it in a really simple way.

Software dev is the process of **designing, creating, testing and maintaining** computer programs.

Now that is a lot of words but personally at the beginning of my journey as a developer I was just as confused as I was before so i will simplify it a bit more.

 - **Designing**: Putting it down on paper 
 - **Creating**: Programming 
 - **Testing**: Trying out what we have programmed 
 - **Maintaining**: Fixing problems and adding new things.

 I will explain all these points in more detail below.

## Designing

 Designing is nothing more than taking the information about what the software should do and how it should look and putting it into a concept that can be programmed.

Now let me give you a practical example: during a conversation your friend says: "Hey, I want you to make me a website for my homemade jam business, can you do that?"

Now your job as a software developer is to design it.

## Creating (Programming)

I know from other colleagues that explaining programming to someone outside the field is quite difficult without technical terms, so I thought long and hard and found the perfect sentence to sum it up.


**I tell computers what to do, and sometimes they listen.**

It is as simple as that.

## Testing

Testing means trying out what you have programmed and seeing if it works as intended.

## Maintaining

It is about fixing errors and adding new stuff to the programm
