# Tools i use

So, now you know how I got into repairing phones (if you didn’t catch up, you can read it [here](./2025-09-14-how-i-got-into-repairing-phones.md)).  
The next question is: what tools do I use, where did I buy them, and what advice can I give you on what to be careful about when buying stuff?

First of all, here’s a quick overview of what I’ve got:

- [Manta driver kit](#manta-driver-kit)  
- [Anti-static mat](#anti-static-mat)  
- [Anti-static tweezers](#anti-static-tweezers)  
- [Triangle plastic pry opening tool](#triangle-plastic-pry-opening-tool)  
- [Duster](#duster)  
- [3M 94 primer](#3m-94-primer)  
- [Screen glue tape](#screen-glue-tape)  
- [Glasses cleaning cloths](#glasses-cleaning-cloths)  
- [Silica pearls](#silica-pearls)  



## Manta Driver Kit
There’s not much to say here—I already reviewed it [here](./2025-09-14-thoughts-on-iFixit-Manta-Driver-Kit.md), so you can check out my full thoughts.

## Anti-Static Mat
I got mine from AliExpress, like most of my tools. I wanted something cheap at the start because I didn’t think I would repair that many phones. Honestly, I’m really happy with it.





## Anti-Static Tweezers
These also came from AliExpress. They’re not essential, but I’m glad I have them for dealing with tiny stuck screws or small parts. Better safe than sorry, as I always say.




## Triangle Plastic Pry Opening Tool
I bought two kinds, and I must say the first ones I got were terrible. Please buy flat ones, and avoid the ones like the first you can’t open a phone with them. Like 90% of my tools, these came from AliExpress.

## Duster
If I remember correctly, this came as part of the kit with the tweezers, so I’d call that a win-win.




## 3M 94 Primer
Not a must-have, but I really enjoy working with it. It helps phone screens and parts hold together much better, and for the price, I’d recommend it. Got this from AliExpress as well.




## Screen Glue Tape
This is the only thing I bought from Amazon because I needed it quickly for my first repair. It’s great, but once it’s finished, I’ll switch to buying from AliExpress.


## Glasses Cleaning Cloths
I first used these because my brother wears glasses, and they were always lying around the house. I’ve been using them for years to clean phone screens. Now I just buy them at my local convenience store—no special brand, just whatever is available.

## Silica Pearls
I’ve never had to use these, and I hope I never will (water damage and I are natural enemies). But I like to be prepared for every situation.

# Where i Buy them

While writing this, it occurred to me that I could also share where I buy my phone parts. And if you guessed AliExpress, you’re right.  

Why AliExpress? Am I affiliated with them or hoping for a sponsorship? No. The reason is simple: this started (and still is hopefully it stays this way, since software development is my passion) as a hobby. I usually repair phones for friends or relatives. About 90% of the time, I don’t make any profit. They cover the cost of parts, and sometimes they’ll buy me a beer afterward but that’s about it.  

So long story short: I buy my parts from three different sellers on AliExpress, grouped like this:  

- [Phone parts](https://jiaruila.aliexpress.com/store/836688)  
- [Displays](https://aumook.aliexpress.com/store/5735303)  
- [Batteries](https://losoncoer.aliexpress.com/store/212177)
