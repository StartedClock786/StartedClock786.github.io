# How I Got Into Repairing Phones

The story of how I got into repairing phones is actually quite hilarious. I work in software development, so people just assume I’m good with *all* IT-related stuff—which, as anyone in the IT field knows, is far from the truth. I know my way around software and how to develop it, sure, but if you asked me to set up a proper corporate network, it would take me ages.  

Anyway, enough with my silly IT comments. You’re here for the real story.  

It all started on the **31st of October last year** (Halloween my favorite holiday, by the way). My best friend dropped her phone on the way home. The funny thing? The screen went completely black without a single crack. Everything else worked notifications came in, her alarm went off she just couldn’t see a thing. The next day, which was a Saturday, she went out and bought a new phone.  

I met her the following Tuesday. She was crying, telling me her old phone had broken and that she hadn’t backed up her data for the past two years. (**No backup, no pity!** I know, I know!) But since I “work in software development,” she assumed I could magically fix it. Like I said before, I’m not a wizard but I did feel bad for her, so I promised I’d at least *try*.  

What she didn’t know was that back in my teens, I spent a lot of time tinkering with repairs alongside my grandpa. He was a mechanic, a handyman, and pretty much a repair legend. I don’t think I ever saw something he *couldn’t* fix. I picked up a lot of those skills and hoped I could transfer them to taking the phone apart, figuring out what was broken, fixing it, and (hopefully) putting it back together without making things worse.  

So, armed with a cheap set of screwdrivers I had lying around (no fancy iFixit kit back then) and a YouTube tutorial, I took her phone apart. It turned out the screen needed replacing. I ordered a new one, carefully transferred all the components, and—much to my relief the phone powered back on and worked perfectly.  

And that’s how I stumbled into the world of phone repairs.
